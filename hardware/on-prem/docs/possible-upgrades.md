# possible-upgrades

## System76 Wild Dog Pro

- Use System76 Wild Dog Pro as my "home server" for next $X years.
    - Upgrade to 64GB memory (must be DDR4)
    - Add SSD (and maybe HD) storage up to 18TB
    - TBD: Add graphics card
        - Add an Nvidia graphics card which will support running <10b param models locally.
        - Use PCIe.
        - Will require replacing the power supply.
            - Current power supply is 500W, and majority of Nvidia cards need higher.
    - TBD: Replace CPU
        - Intel Generation
            - Motherboard supports the 6th and 7th generation Intel Architecture (i.e. Intel H170 Express Chipset)
                - 6th gen is Skylake
                    - First one w/ DDR4 memory support. Previous generation (Broadwell) does not support.
                - 7th gen is Kaby Lake
                - Does _not_ support 12th gen (Alder Lake) which is when Intel added E/P-cores.
        - Within 6th/7th gen, can choose between i5 and i7.
            - i7 is more powerful, but also draws more power.
    - TBD: Use PCIe for 10GB NIC (replace 1GB ethernet)

## ThinkPad x220

- Upgrade ThinkPad x220 with more memory and SSD and use as backup server (or
  tbd...)
    - Upgrade to 16GB memory (must be DDR3)
    - Replace the primary hard drive w/ SATA SSD.
    - Cannot upgrade CPU bc soldered in place.
