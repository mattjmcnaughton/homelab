# on-prem

Documentation (and maybe light IaC) for on-prem hardware.

The initial provisioning of on-prem hardware will likely require _some_
manual intervention, that we will want to document.

As quickly as possible, our focus will be getting our on-prem hardware in a
state where we can utilize Ansible, OpenTofu, kubectl, etc.
